# 2. Use NetEscapades for security headers

Date: 2023-09-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Up until now, we have been setting static response security headers in a custom middleware. We encountered some scenarios where we need to use inline `<script>` tags:

* The GOV.UK design system requires the use of inline script tags (to add the `js-enabled` class name).
* We may also need to use inline script to initialise the accessible-autocomplete component, which we will be using for search.

These uses of inline script should be secured with nonces.

## Decision

We will use [NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders nuget package](https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders) to secure our inline scripts. This package is widely used across RSD products and is recommended by the [SDD technical documentation repo](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/sdd-technical-documentation/blob/main/how_to_guides/security_hardening_in_aspnet_core_web_apps.md).

In order to keep our security header configuration consistent, we will also use this package to configure our other security headers.

## Consequences

We have added nonce attributes to inline scripts using the [NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders nuget package](https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders).

We have made further use of NetEscapade security header methods to replace the majority of security headers previously set in our middlewareâ€”so that all of the security headers are set in one place.

We still need to manually set the X-Robots-Tag using the custom middleware, to define our desired search engine behaviour.
