Use this rule to review and improve code that was generated by AI (e.g., Cursor or Copilot).

## Guidelines

- Check that all selectors follow POM and `data-testid` conventions.
- Confirm all assertions are meaningful, specific, and not duplicated.
- Remove unnecessary complexity (e.g., deeply nested `.then()` or async).
- Validate test structure: clear `describe/it`, reusable logic, good naming.
- Check the test doesn't rely on flakey timing or implicit waits.
- Add missing comments or docblocks if intent isn't obvious.
- Replace any inline `cy.get()` with the correct POM method if available.
