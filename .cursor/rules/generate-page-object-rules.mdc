Use this rule when generating a new Page Object file from an existing UI page or test.

## Guidelines

- Use the `class <PageName>Page` convention.
- Use `data-testid` selectors if available as these are the most robust for test.
- Group related elements into named methods or getters (e.g., `get breadcrumbs()`, `get actionButtons()`).
- Avoid returning raw `cy.get(...)` calls; wrap them in methods for clarity.
- Include a comment above each method describing its purpose and usage.
- Export the class as default.
- Assume use with Cypress and TypeScript.
