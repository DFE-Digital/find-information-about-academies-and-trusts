@a11y
@axe
@accessibility

Use this rule when writing accessibility tests using `cypress-axe`.

## Guidelines

- Inject Axe using `cy.injectAxe()` after page load or route change.
- Use `cy.checkA11y()` scoped to the main content container.
- Suppress known false positives with configuration where justified.
- Tag tests as `@accessibility` for traceability.
- Write assertions that fail clearly (e.g., log violations to console).
- Where issues are found, recommend remediations in comments.
- Include accessibility checks in both the main page and key modal/dialog components.
