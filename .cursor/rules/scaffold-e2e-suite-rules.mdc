Use this rule to scaffold a new E2E test suite for a frontend app using Cypress and TypeScript.

## Guidelines

- Create folder structure:
  - `e2e/` with subfolders: `pages/`, `tests/`, `utils/`, `fixtures/`
- Create an example test with proper structure using `describe/it`, POM, and assertions.
- Create a sample page object class and corresponding test using `data-testid`.
- Include `cypress.config.ts` setup with custom baseUrl and retry settings.
- Include sample command in `cypress/support/commands.ts`.
- Provide basic documentation in markdown for getting started (`TESTING.md`).
