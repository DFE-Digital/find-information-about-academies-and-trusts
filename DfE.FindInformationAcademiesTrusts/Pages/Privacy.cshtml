    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      This notice explains why we use personal information and how.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Our legal basis for processing your data
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The law says that we can use the data you provide to:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>in the exercise of our functions as a government department</li>
      <li>perform a task in the public interest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Where your data is stored and processed
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The DfE holds and processes personal information within the United Kingdom (UK) and under contracted services, within the European Economic Area (EEA).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while being processed by DfE. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      How long we keep your data
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We will only keep your personal data for as long as:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the law requires us to</li>
      <li>we need for the purposes listed under ‘Why we use it’</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Under law, personal data can be kept for longer periods of time when processed purely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, and statistical purposes.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We can keep non-public personal data for 6 years. It is then reviewed annually.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Who we share your data with
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We may share information we hold about you with certain organisations where the law allows it, or if we have a legal obligation to do so. We may share information with other organisations, including the following:

      <li>organisations contracted with us and/or by the above organisations to undertake work for them, requiring them to manage your information</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law — for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
