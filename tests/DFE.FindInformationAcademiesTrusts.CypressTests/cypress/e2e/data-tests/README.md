# Data-Driven Tests

This directory is reserved for future data-driven tests that will use external data sources for comprehensive testing scenarios.

## Current Status

**ðŸš§ Not Yet Implemented** - This directory structure is prepared for future development when data-driven testing requirements are defined.

## Planned Structure

```text
data-tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/           # Test data files (JSON, CSV, external APIs)
â”œâ”€â”€ data-providers/     # Services to fetch and generate test data
â”œâ”€â”€ bulk-testing/       # Tests that run against multiple data sets
â”œâ”€â”€ data-validation/    # Tests focused on data integrity and accuracy
â””â”€â”€ performance/        # Data-heavy scenarios for performance validation
```

## Future Implementation Goals

When implemented, this directory will support:

- **Bulk Trust Testing**: Validate multiple trusts using production-like data
- **Academy Data Validation**: Cross-reference academy information with external sources
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test scenarios using boundary and edge case data
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Validate data consistency across different sources
- **Performance Testing**: Test application performance with large data sets
- **Regression Testing**: Use historical data to test for regressions

## Prepared npm Scripts

```json
{
  "cy:data:open": "cypress open --spec 'cypress/e2e/data-tests/**/*.cy.ts'",
  "cy:data:run": "cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/data-tests/**/*.cy.ts'"
}
```

## Benefits of Separate Structure

- **Independent Execution**: Run data tests separately from functional and accessibility tests
- **CI/CD Flexibility**: Can be scheduled differently (e.g., nightly runs with full data sets)
- **Resource Management**: Data tests may require different permissions or data access
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain test data separately from test logic
- **Scalability**: Can handle large-scale testing scenarios without affecting other test suites

## Integration with Existing Tests

Data-driven tests will complement the existing test structure:

```text
cypress/e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ accessibility/      # âœ… Implemented - WCAG compliance testing
â”œâ”€â”€ regression/         # âœ… Implemented - UI functionality testing  
â””â”€â”€ data-tests/         # ðŸš§ Future - Data-driven comprehensive testing
```

## Technical Considerations

Future implementation will consider:

- **Data Source Integration**: APIs, databases, CSV files, JSON fixtures
- **Test Data Management**: Data generation, cleanup, and isolation
- **Performance Impact**: Efficient data loading and test execution
- **Security**: Secure handling of test data and credentials
- **Reporting**: Enhanced reporting for data-driven test results

This structure ensures we're prepared for data-driven testing when business requirements and technical specifications are established.
